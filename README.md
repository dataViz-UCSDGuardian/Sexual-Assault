# Sexual-Assault

In this repository you will find sexual assault data from the UCSD police report and two visualizations displaying number of offenses over the years by each offense and the number of offenses in each location by each offense.

The data was taken from page 64 of http://www.police.ucsd.edu/docs/annualclery.pdf, and manually created into a csv file. The variables included are:
- **Offense**: offenses included were rape, fondling, statutory rape, dating violence, stalking
- **Year**: years from 2015 - 2017
- number of offenses were given by location: **On-Campus Housing Facilities**,	**On-Campus Total**,	**Non-Campus**,	**Public Property**
- **Total**: total offenses by year and by offense
